The purpose of this project is to create a website where people can rate ski runs and describe them, such as by giving level of difficulty and talking about good and bad things about the run (i.e. it’s very bumpy, or it is long and flat). This will help people identify runs they would like to go on and runs they would like to avoid, so they don’t find themselves on runs they are not comfortable doing or that are too easy for them. Although ski runs are rated by the ski resorts, these ratings are not very detailed (just beginning, intermediate, and advanced, in most places) and can vary from place to place, or even within one resort.
